Exaggerated kyphosis with increased AP dimension of the thorax, curvilinear density projected over the right anterior 3rd and 4th ribs beyond which lung markings are seen XXXX skin fold artifact. Mild aortic ectasia/tortuosity, no typical mediastinal widening to suggest vascular injury. Contour irregularity of the lateral right 9th rib of indeterminate age.", "target": "1. No acute cardiopulmonary findings. 2. Age-indeterminate fracture of the right lateral 9th rib. If findings localize to this region, suspect acute fracture."}

Negative for acute displaced rib fracture.", "target": "Negative for acute abnormality."}
{"source": "The lungs are clear bilaterally. Specifically, no evidence of focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures of the thorax are without acute abnormality.", "target": "No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality."}
{"source": "There is prominence of the superior mediastinum which may be partially due to patient's known thyroid mass. There is increased tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Lungs are clear without focal opacification. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is scoliotic curvature the thoracic spine. No acute bone abnormality.", "target": "Increasing prominence of the superior mediastinum may be secondary to enlarging thyroid mass. With increasing tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and concern for dissection, chest CT is recommended for further evaluation."}
{"source": "The heart is normal in size. The mediastinum is unremarkable. Left perihilar scarring is noted in the upper lobe.
